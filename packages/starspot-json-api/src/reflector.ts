/**
 * A Reflector allows Starspot to retrieve information about a model. For
 * example, to serialize a model to JSON, Starspot needs to be able to ask it
 * for a list of its attributes.
 * 
 * Reflectors allow Starspot to be ORM-agnostic. Instead of hardcoding Starspot
 * to a particular ORM, anyone can write a reflector and install it on models of
 * their ORM of choice (or even use reflectors on objects that come from an
 * ORM).
